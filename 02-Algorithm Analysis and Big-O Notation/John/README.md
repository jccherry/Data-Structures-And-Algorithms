I read Chapter 3, focusing on 3.2 and 3.3

I did problems R-3.2,R-3.3,R-3.6,R-3.8, and the Algorithm Analysis Questions R-3.23-R-3.3.27

I checked some of the earlier problems using excel, and for R-3.25 i wasnâ€™t sure of my initial answer so i modified the code of the problem and created a set of ordered pairs to plot and confirm my theory that the answer was O(N^2)
