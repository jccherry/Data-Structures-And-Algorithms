## Unit 01: Introduction to Python

Already very familiar with Python2/3, I've listed a few projects I've made which used the language to prove I am fluent.

- [Fieri](https://github.com/Apexal/fieri)
- [TRMS](https://github.com/Apexal/trms)
- [TRP](https://github.com/Apexal/trp)
- Local Youth Group Website (private repo using Flask)
- Site for Discord server (private repo using Flask)

Besides this, I often use Python for basic automation scripts on my desktop or when I'm testing out a new idea.
