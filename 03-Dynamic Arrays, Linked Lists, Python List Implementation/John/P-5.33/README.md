## P-5.33
Write a Python Program for a matrix class that can add and multiply two dimensional arrays of numbers, assuming that the dimensions agree appropriately for the operation

I've also included a PDF document which i do the matrix multiplication out by hand to prove that i'm correct, but this algorithm will work for any two matrices of dimensions mxn and nxp

Sample output of Adding:
```
[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

+

[1.0, 11.0, 1.0, 1.0]
[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

----------------------------------------------

[2.0, 12.0, 2.0, 2.0]
[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]
[2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]

```

Sample output of Multiplying:
```
[2.0, 4.0]
[3.0, 1.0]

*

[1.0, 2.0, 5.0]
[3.0, 4.0, 6.0]

----------------------------------------------

[14.0, 20.0, 34.0]
[6.0, 10.0, 21.0]
```
