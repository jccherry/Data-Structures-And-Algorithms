did problems r-5.7,r-5.11, and project P-5.33

relevant work that i've done previously with 2d datasets/matrices in swift can also be found [here](https://github.com/jccherry/Matrices)

I also made a fun project for accounting [here](https://github.com/jccherry/Autoledger) which used a whole bunch of lists and good stuff
